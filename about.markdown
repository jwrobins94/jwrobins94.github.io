I write about machine learning in recommendation systems, large language models, and related areas. This site contains:
1. General brainstorming and commentary on various topics.
2. Notes from personal projects.

## About Me
### Work
I spent 2019 - 2024 working in ad ranking at [Snap](https://eng.snap.com/machine-learning-snap-ad-ranking?lang=en-US), with 4 years as a Machine Learning Engineer in the Ads Core Modeling team and a 5th year as manager of the Web Ad Ranking team. Most of my work focused on improving the predictive accuracy of our ranking models via new training techniques and deep learning architectures.

I spent 2016 - 2019 as the ML tech lead at [Scaled Inference](https://techcrunch.com/2014/07/29/scaled-inference-2/) working on contextual bandits / reinforcement learning.

Before that, internships:
- Two full-time summers with part-time work in between as an ML intern working on fraud dection models at [Sift](https://sift.com/).
- One semester at [BigML](https://bigml.com/) developing a clustering tool.
- One part-time semester + summer internship working on the [CHIMP](https://www.cmu.edu/news/stories/archives/2015/june/CHIMP-finishes-third.html) robot at Carnegie Mellon's [NREC](https://www.nrec.ri.cmu.edu/).
- One summer automating resistor chain design via particle swarm + gradient-based optimization methods at [Audience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audience_(company)).

### Education
I received my B.S. in Computer Science and Minor in Machine Learning from Carnegie Mellon University in 2016.

I was fortunate to be able to focus a lot of my time at CMU on ML and game theory, including:
- Machine Learning (10-601)
- Advanced Introduction to Machine Learning (10-715)
- Probabilistic Graphical Models (10-708)
- Algorithms, Games, and Networks (15-896)
- Intermediate Statistics (10-705)
- Statistical Machine Learning (10-702)

### Hobbies

I [compete](https://www.openpowerlifting.org/u/joeyrobinson) in powerlifting and enjoy [underwater macro photography](https://adobe.ly/3H7IWmw).
